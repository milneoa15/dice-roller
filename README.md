# Dice Roller

A stylish two-player dice roller that lets you customize how many dice to throw and how many sides each die has. Adjust the settings, challenge a friend, and see who scores the highest total.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to launch the app. Use the controls at the top of the card to pick the number of dice (up to 12) and the number of sides per die (2â€“100). Click **Roll dice** to generate results for both players or **Reset** to return to the default setup.
